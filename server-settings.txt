# The amount of memory in MB to allocate to the server. The default value here (1024)
# is higher than needed in most cases, but with very large text collections, it may

# The absolute path to an existing parent directory that the server should use for data.
# The server doesn't delete data when it's terminated but by default the data folder
# can be a temporary directory that may disappear after a machine restart.
# Leave this blank to use the default directory. The default directory will be a
# temporary directory determined by your operation system UNLESS there's a folder
# called data in the same directory as this settings file – in that case the data folder
# will be used. If you want this behaviour, just create an empty data folder in this
# directory (after that, you can zip up the parent folder and redistribute VoyantServer
# with existing data – this can be used in conjunction with the uri_path below to open
# up an existing corpus automatically (/?corpus=id where id is replaced by the real
# corpus ID that you've created). If the data directory exists and you want to use it
# leave this value blank.

# The URI path (after the domain) to use (default is /). This is a good way to provide
