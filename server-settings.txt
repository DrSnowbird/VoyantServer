### Settings for VoyantServer ###

# These are settings that define default values for VoyantServer. In most cases
# the indicated values can be used (or blank to use a default). You can also 
# override the values in this settings file if you launch VoyantServer from the
# command line by using -Dorg.voyanttools.server.SETTING=VALUE. For instance:
# java -Dorg.voyanttools.server.memory=2048 -jar VoyantServer.jar headless=true

# The port to use for the web server (default is 8888). If a port is already in use,
# this can be changed (8889, etc.). If the server terminated unexpectedly the port
# may continue being used and restarting the machine is one way of resetting things.
port = 8888

# The amount of memory in MB to allocate to the server. The default value here (1024)
# is higher than needed in most cases, but with very large text collections, it may
# need to be even higher (2048, 4096, etc.)
memory = 1024

# The absolute path to an existing parent directory that the server should use for data.
# VoyantServer is usually distributed with an existing data subfolder that is pre-populated
# with some corpora (which are referenced by the built-in documentation). You have several
# options:
# 1) leave the "data_directory" setting below blank and
# 	a) leave the existing data folder and existing corpora in place (do nothing, recommended)
# 	b) remove the contents of the data folder (but not the folder itself) to start clean
#   c) remove the data folder to use a subfolder of the system's temporary directory
# 2) specify the absolute path of an existing parent data directory
data_directory =

# The URI path (after the domain) to use (default is /). This is a good way to provide
# load a corpus by default, ex: uri_path = /?input=http://cbc.ca/news/ or /?corpus=333.333
# (where 333.333 is an existing local corpus).
# It's also possible to build a custom menu for the open menu on the front page. Separate
# the corpus ID and a label by a colon and separate multiple entries by commas, making sure
# to escape characters (like spaces), eg:  /?openMenu=444.444:Corpus+One;555.555:Corpus+Two
uri_path = /

# This allows you to limit traffic to the specific host (domain or IP). By default (127.0.0.1)
# it is set to be restrictive and to only accept local requests (in order to favour privacy).
# VoyantServer is also a convenient way to host an instance of Voyant Tools that you might
# want to have more widely accessible, in which case you should comment out this line or remove
# the value.
# host = 127.0.0.1

# By default VoyantServer will direct output to the console window within the VoyantServer
# application (this is a useful place to see what's happening, especially when things go
# wrong); when in headless mode, logs are simply directed to the standard output. This
# setting allows you to direct VoyantServer logs to a file instead, which is especially
# useful when you want to leave a server running and detached from the console
# value should be true or anything else for false (including blank).
