# this can be changed (8889, etc.). If the server terminated unexpectedly the port
# may continue being used and restarting the machine is one way of resetting things.

# The amount of memory in MB to allocate to the server. The default value here (1024)
# is higher than needed in most cases, but with very large text collections, it may
# need to be even higher (2048, 4096, etc.)

# The absolute path to an existing parent directory that the server should use for data.
# The server doesn't delete data when it's terminated but by default the data folder
# can be a temporary directory that may disappear after a machine restart.
# Leave this blank to use the default directory. The default directory will be a
# temporary directory determined by your operation system UNLESS there's a folder
# called data in the same directory as this settings file – in that case the data folder
# will be used. If you want this behaviour, just create an empty data folder in this
# directory (after that, you can zip up the parent folder and redistribute VoyantServer
# with existing data – this can be used in conjunction with the uri_path below to open
# up an existing corpus automatically (/?corpus=id where id is replaced by the real
# corpus ID that you've created). If the data directory exists and you want to use it
# leave this value blank.
data_directory = 

# The URI path (after the domain) to use (default is /). This is a good way to provide
# load a corpus by default, ex: uri_path = /?input=http://cbc.ca/news/ or /?corpus=333.333
# (where 333.333 is an existing local corpus).
# It's also possible to build a custom menu for the open menu on the front page. Separate
# the corpus ID and a label by a colon and separate multiple entries by commas, making sure
# to escape characters (like spaces), eg:  /?openMenu=444.444:Corpus+One;555.555:Corpus+Two
uri_path = /

# This allows you to limit traffic to the specific host (domain or IP). By default (127.0.0.1)
# it is set to be restrictive and to only accept local requests (in order to favour privacy).
# VoyantServer is also a convenient way to host an instance of Voyant Tools that you might
# want to have more widely accessible, in which case you should comment out this line or remove
# the value.
